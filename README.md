Hi, this is a simple C++ launcher to launch Half-Life 2 and subsequently all Source Engine games.
This code can be edited to your liking or however you need it for the game you want to launch.
I will be making more variants of this launcher for other Source Engine games, specifically the ones I own and play.
Black Mesa, Half-Life 2 (steam_legacy branch), Portal, etc etc. 
Make sure to place this file in the same directory as hl2.exe, otherwise it will not work.
Also, make sure to change the icon too, if you don't it'll have the default Steam Half-Life 2 icon lol.
